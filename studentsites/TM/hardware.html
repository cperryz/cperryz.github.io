<p><img src="images\motherboard.jpg" alt="motherboard"width="400" height="200"> 
<p>The motherboard is the main hardware component of the computer. Without the motherboard the computer will not even turn on. The motherboard is a printed circuit board that is the foundation of a computer, located on the back side or at the bottom of the computer chassis. It allocates power and allows communication to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components. When building a computer, the motherboard will be the first priority for the creator to choose. this is the main component that links all the other components together.

<p>The ram is another important hardware component when it comes to using a computer or even building one. RAM is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually associated with DRAM, which is a type of memory module. Because information is accessed randomly instead of sequentially like it is on a CD or hard drive, the computer can access the data much faster. However, unlike ROM or the hard drive, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost.

<p>A USB port is another very important hardware component in the computer.It is a port which enables you to put in a USB and access all your data and information on to the computer. as well as accessing data and information, you can also use it for smart phones to charge them and even access data such as photos on to the computer.
