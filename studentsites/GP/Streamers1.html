<h1>Tyler 1....</h1>
<p><font size = "+1" color = "">
           Tyler1 is known as League of legends' most notorious league of legends streamer. He is very egotistical
           and often refers to himself as an 'Alpha male'. His tendency to 'flame' his teamates in League of legends
           matches is profound and he is known to have a world record of 21 banned accounts as of 2016- he has recieved
           an indefinite ban by Riot games-meaning he cannot just make a new account and stream due to his public status. 
           He is League of legends' most toxic player- making him the perfect streamer. As of January 2018, the ban has
           been lifted by Riot games and he is allowed to stream League gameplay again. This is because, he has shown 
           evidence of reform and repent to riot and they have accepted this. Tyler1 himself described his ban as
           " AFTER 613 DAYS OF INTENSE REHAB I AM FINALLY UNBANNED FROM LEAGUE OF LEGENDS". His fans and viewers have
           experienced his 'Rehab' from league of legends; with him often resorting to cooking streams and other IRl
           activities. He is so entertaining to his viewers because of his severe autism which helps his personality shine.
