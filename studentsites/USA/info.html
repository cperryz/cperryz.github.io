AUDI AG is a German company which produces cars under the Audi brand. 
It is part of the Volkswagen Group. The name Audi is based on a Latin 
translation of the surname of the founder August Horch, itself the German
 word for “listen!" Audi is headquartered in Ingolstadt, Germany.

On July 16, 1909 automotive pioneer August Horch founded August Horch 
Automobilwerke GmbH in Germany. A short time later he renamed the company 
after the Latin translation of his last name – making it Audi Automobilwerke.

In 1932, Audi merged with Horch, DKW and Wanderer, to form Auto Union AG. 
The four rings of the Audi badge symbolize the brands Audi, DKW, Horch and 
Wanderer. Before World War II, Auto Union AG used the four interlinked rings,
 only on Auto Union racing cars in that period. Member companies used their own 
 names and emblems.
 
 Auto Union GmbH was established in Ingolstadt on September 3rd, 1949 following 
 a series of changes as WWII came to an end.

Daimler-Benz AG acquired the majority of and finally the remaining shares in
 Auto Union GmbH on April 24th, 1958. From this date until the end of 1965, 
 Auto Union was a fully owned subsidiary of the Stuttgart-based Daimler Group.

Volkswagenwerk AG acquired the majority of shares in Auto Union GmbH in December
 1964, with Audi becoming a fully owned VW subsidiary from the end of 1966.
