The calm within the storm. As the world becomes more connected,
 so does the new Audi range. With even more intuitive technology,
 like adaptive cruise control and self-learning personal route functions,
 its as if the new Audi Q5 has a brain.

Likewise, with our revolutionary quattro on demand,
 the Q5 can switch between all-wheel drive and front-wheel drive 
 in a fraction of a second - just by monitoring driving dynamics,
 road conditions and driver behaviour. This is Audi intelligent technology.
