 <p style="text-align:center;">A lot of us may have missed out on Pink Floyd's glory days. However, we still have a chance to see Roger Waters live in 2018. Alternatively there are many great tribute bands dedicated to bringing the Pink Floyd sound to this generation.</p>
 <p style="text-align:center;">Nick Mason; the Pink Floyd drummer and founding member of the band has ceated a new project called "Saucerful of Secrets" to play their early material. Nick said "This is a unique opportunity to experience Pink Floyd’s celebrated and significant early body of work played live including songs from albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets.” The super group consists of former Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt, The Blockheads guitarist Lee Harris, Spandau Ballets Gary Kemp, and composer Dom Beken.</p>
