 <div class="Newscolour" </div><h1>Microsoft won&#39;t reveal amount of sales?</h1>
 </p><img src="Xbox.png" style="width: 100%;"><p>
 </p>Microsoft is providing a vague update on its Xbox One sales today, after remaining largely silent for years on exactly how many consoles have been sold. 
 &#34;Xbox One sales are up 15 percent over the same period last year&#34; says Microsoft&#39;s game marketing chief, Mike Nichols, in a blog post about &#34;recording-setting&#34; 
 Xbox numbers. The blog post still doesn&#39;t include any actual sales numbers, so it&#39;s hard to tell exactly how well the Xbox One is doing. Either way, 
 it&#39;s encouraging for Microsoft that its Xbox One sales are growing this year after the launch of the Xbox One X.<p>

</p>Microsoft happily provided sales figures when the console first launched back in 2013, but the company soon stopped reporting 
numbers after it passed the 10 million milestone three months after Sony&#39;s PS4. Instead, Microsoft has been largely focused on providing numbers on 
active Xbox Live users, instead of hardware sales. Even today&#39;s blog post includes &quot;Xbox Live players are up 13 percent,&quot; and that 600,000 friendships have been 
forged through the new Looking For Group feature. There are also more than 1.2 million clubs on Xbox Live now.<p>
