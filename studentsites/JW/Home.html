<div style="margin-left:20%;padding:1px 16px;height:1000px;">
	<center><p class="padding3"> This is a test to see how human you actually are, by testing your curiosity.</p></center>
	<p class="padding3">Torah Kachur a science columnist once said this...</p>
	
	<p class="padding3">Curiosity is what motivates us to learn what is true in the world. It comes when we feel a gap between what we know and what we want to know,
	You can think of it like a mental itch, and the only way to scratch the itch is to seek out new knowledge.
Curiosity is a fundamental impulse shared by humans. And it's an important skill — one that helps us make better predictions about what will happen in our lives. </p>

<p class="padding3">We humans have a deeply curious nature, and more often than not it is about the minor tittle-tattle in our lives.
Our curiosity has us doing utterly unproductive things like reading news about people we will never meet, 
learning topics we will never have use for, or exploring places we will never come back to. 
We just love to know the answers to things, even if there's no obvious benefit. </p>


<p class="padding5">From the perspective of evolution this appears to be something of a mystery. 
We associate evolution with ‘survival-of-the-fittest’ traits that support the essentials of day-to-day survival and reproduction. 
So why did we evolve to waste so much time? Shouldn't evolution have selected for a species which was – you know – a bit more focused? </p>
