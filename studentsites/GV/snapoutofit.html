[Verse 1]
<br>
What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love, or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth (yeah)
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here
Waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap
Out
Of
It
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down
Or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here
Waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap
Out
Of
It
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
Under a spell you're hypnotized (ooh)
Darling how could you be so blind? (snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized (ooh)
Darling how could you be so blind?
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here
Waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap
Out
Of
It
