[Verse 1]
<br>
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do
<br>
<br>
[Instrumental Break]
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
