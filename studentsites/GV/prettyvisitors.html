[Verse 1]
<br>
Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your head gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I am unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]
<br>
Behold there's a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
