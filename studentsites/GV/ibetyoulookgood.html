[Verse 1]
<br>
Stop making the eyes at me, I'll stop making my eyes at you
What it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to
<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]
<br>
And your shoulders are frozen (As cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-go
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
I wish you'd stop ignoring me because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair
<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]
<br>
That your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-go
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said, from 1984
