[Verse 1]
<br>
So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantonna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]
<br>
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
The look of love, the rush of blood
The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the colour dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah
