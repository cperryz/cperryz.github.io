[Verse 1]
<br>
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you fall in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire
<br>
<br>
[Chorus - Revised]
<br>
I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken
I just wanna hear you say "you got me baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
<br>
<br>
[Chorus - Revised]
<br>
I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
