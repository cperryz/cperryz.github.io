[Verse 1]
<br>
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you
