[Verse 1]
<br>
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easy
To pretend that you were just some lover
<br>
<br>
[Instrumental break]
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?
