[Verse 1]
<br>
Lately I've been seeing things, belly button piercings
In the sky at night when we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabroilet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it, just in case
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Does it help you stay up late? Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it, but you don't want it now
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesiser
And I tried last night to pack away your laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it
<br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle
