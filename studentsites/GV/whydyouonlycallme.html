[Verse 1]
<br>
The mirror's image, tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving, carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming, of bumping into you
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Somewhere darker, talking the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen, more I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions, and having bad ideas
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
And I can't see you here, wondering where I might
It sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found all I was hoping to find
You said you got to be up in the morning, going to have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby, why'd you only call me when you're high?
<br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
