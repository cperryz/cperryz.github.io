[Verse 1]
<br>
I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?
<br>
<br>
[Instrumental break]
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]
<br>
Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh
<br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
