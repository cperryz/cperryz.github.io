They have a 6th album rumoured to be released in May 2018, the information for this was given by the drummer Matt Helders in a conversation with a fan but was not confirmed by representatives of the band. The album has since been confirmed to have a release date of May 11th 2018 and the title will be 'Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino'. Their debut album is the fastest-selling debut album by a band in British chart history and is confirmed to be re-issued on vinyl at some stage in 2018.
