[Chorus]
<br>
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]
<br>
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
<br>
<br>
[Instrumental break]
<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]
<br>
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile
