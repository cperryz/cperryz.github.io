[Chorus]
<br>
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]
<br>
I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms, thunderstorms, thunderstorms
