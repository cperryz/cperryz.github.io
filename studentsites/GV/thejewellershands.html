[Verse 1]
<br>
Fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly, stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
In the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned
<br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it engraved
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it engraved
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
