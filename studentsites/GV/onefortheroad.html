[Intro]
<br>
One for the road, oooh oooh
One for the road, oooh oooh
<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]
<br>
From the bottom of your heart, the relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
One for the road
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake rattle and roll
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
One for the road
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
<br>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
One for the road
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
