The Vanguard are elite Guardians who coordinate the Last City's defenses, organize assaults on enemy strongholds and assassinations of their leaders, and mentor newly-risen Guardians. Some Guardians work directly for the Vanguard as scouts, investigating potential threats to the City far afield.
<br> <br>
The members of the Vanguard sell armor specific to their class, as well as guide players through story content via Quests. The Vanguard also sells weapons, armor and equipment through their Quartermaster, Roni. The Vanguard guides the player through the base game's questline and each subclass quest, as well as playing an important role in organizing a resistance against Oryx during the Taken War. Vanguard Reputation is gained by completing Vanguard Bounties, Strikes, or missions while on Patrol.

As a result of the invasion of the Last City led by Dominus Ghaul, the destruction of the Tower and the onset of the Red War, the Vanguard has been thrown into disarray. While the Vanguards leadership survived the initial invasion, they became displaced and questioned over how they would overcome the Red Legion.

However, they were reunited by The Guardian, and fought in the Red War against the Red Legion and Ghaul. After the successful liberation of the City and the awakening of the Traveler, the Vanguard set up a new base near the ruins of the old Tower.

"When a terrible threat rises, Guardians look to the Vanguard, the closest thing they have to a command structure. These elite veterans coordinate the reports of roaming Hunters, the analyses of cloistered Warlocks, and the instincts of grizzled Titans into a single plan of action."
<br> <br>
"Zavala has never shied from hard decisions. His life bends under the double weight of honor and duty, each act of service more exhausting, each victory more costly. Zavala continues anyway. He has never had time for anything softer than iron."
<br> <br>
Ikora Rey's second life has been long and colorful. As an iconoclastic new Guardian, she made a reputation in the Crucible and in the halls of Warlock scholarship as an outspoken, unrelenting opponent with no patience for dogma or etiquette.
<br> <br>
"Cayde-6 was a daring Hunter with a fast ship, a quick gun hand, and an eye on the legendary Vault of Glass. Of course he couldn't say no to a challenge - not even the notorious Vanguard Dare."
