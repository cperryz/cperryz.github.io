The Crucible is the player vs. player game mode in Destiny and Destiny 2.Items bought or earned in the game can be used more effectively in the Crucible, and weapons/armor received elsewhere can also be used in the rest of the game. The Crucible will sometimes randomly reward players after matches, regardless of rank after the game, while players can also purchase weapons from the Crucible Quartermaster as well as Armor and Shaders from Lord Shaxx and Lord Saladin.

The mode returns in Destiny 2, but the player cap has been reduced to 8 players. The HUD has been reworked to give players information on their opponents, such as whether they have their super attack ready or if theyâ€™ve picked up ammo for their power weapon.
