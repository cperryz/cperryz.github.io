Strike is a cooperative mode featured in Destiny. Strikes represent a middle ground in PvE content between Story missions and Raids in terms of length and difficulty, and are optimized for a fireteam of three players. Usually, Strikes are composed of a linear series of enemy encounters which may or may not include a mini-boss, culminating in a battle against one or more bosses supported by additional enemies.[1] Some of the newer strikes feature simple puzzle mechanics that make boss fights more challenging.
<br> <br>
Year One:
These playlists were available during Year One of Destiny, and incorporated all available base game and expansion Strikes. Playlists at higher levels offered greater rewards.

Vanguard Eagle - Level 18
Vanguard Viper - Level 20
Vanguard Wolf - Level 22
Vanguard Tiger - Level 24
Vanguard Roc - Level 26, added by The Dark Below
Vanguard Dragon - Level 28, added by House of Wolves
<br> <br>
Year Two:
The Taken King replaces all Year One playlists with the following:

Vanguard Legacy - Level 20 required, includes all Year One strikes only, no modifiers
Vanguard Strikes - Level 36 required, includes Year Two and select "remixed" Year One strikes, no modifiers
Vanguard Heroic Strikes - Light Level 260 required, includes Year Two and select "remixed" Year One strikes strikes, Heroic and one random modifier active
The Vanguard Heroic playlist replaces the Weekly Heroic Strike; players are rewarded for the first three strikes completed in this playlist each week across all of a player's characters.
<br> <br>
Year Three:
Rise of Iron's Strike playlists retain the Vanguard Legacy and Vanguard Strikes, but adds two new playlists:

SIVA Crisis - Light Level 320 required, includes Strikes from Year One to Year Three with no modifiers.
SIVA Crisis Heroic - Light Level 350 required; includes Strikes from Year One to Year Three; three random Heroic modifiers active per week; replaces Vanguard Heroic.
<br> <br>
Year Four:
Destiny 2 features two Strike playlists apart from the Nightfall. Vanguard Strikes are unlocked after completing the Story mission Fury and returning to The Farm to speak to Commander Zavala. Heroic Strikes are unlocked after completing the first Strike milestone.

Vanguard Strikes - Power Level 140 required, includes all Destiny 2 base game Strikes with no modifiers.
Heroic Strikes - Power Level 270 required, includes all Destiny 2 and Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris strikes with no modifiers.
<br> <br>
Nightfall Strikes:
A random Strike is selected each week for the Nightfall Strike, a high-difficulty challenge with the Nightfall and Epic modifiers active in addition to three other randomly-chosen modifiers; after The Taken King is released, the latter three modifiers will be manually selected by Bungie each week instead of randomized. Nightfall Strikes do not include matchmaking, requiring players to fight alone or assemble a fireteam of three before starting. Rewards include Legendary and Exotic gear.
