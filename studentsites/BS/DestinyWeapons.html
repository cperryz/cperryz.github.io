Exotic weapons are the rarest and coolest-looking guns in "Destiny," the popular shooter from the makers of "Halo." Each one has its own unique perk, designed to help you in clever ways other guns can't.
<br> <br>
Fan Favorites: 
<br>
Bad Juju:"If you believe your weapon wants to murder all existence, then so it will."
There must be a structured, mechanical explanation for this weapon's hunger for combat. There must be. But none has been found.
<br> <br>
Thorn:"To rend one's enemies is to see them not as equals, but objects - hollow of spirit and meaning."
Augmented through dark practices, Thorn was once a hero's weapon. Its jagged frame hints at a sinister truth: a powerful connection to the unutterable sorceries of the Hive. 
The legend of Thorn is bound to the rise and fall of Dredgen Yor, a Guardian whose name is remembered with disgust and shame. The weapon was thought destroyed...but rumors of its existence still haunt the wilds.
<br><br>
 Khvostov 7G-0X:“In battle, you can only count on two things: your comrades and your Khvostov.”
The Khvostov 7G0X was the brainchild of two eras: the Golden Age and the City Age. Shiro-4 used the design schematics for the Khvostov series and a little Guardian ingenuity to craft a modern take on a legendary classic weapon. A fitting tribute to those old weaponsmiths and the newest Iron Lord.
<br><br>
Gjallarhorn:"If there is beauty in destruction, why not also in its delivery?"
The Gjallarhorn shoulder-mounted rocket system was forged from the armor of Guardians who fell at the Twilight Gap. Gifted to the survivors of that terrible battle, the Gjallarhorn is seen as a symbol of honor and survival.
<br> <br>
Vex Mythoclast:...a causal loop within the weapon's mechanism, suggesting that the firing process somehow binds space and time into...
Some legends live forever. Others are overwritten - reshaped by the sheer will of those who believe that any ordeal can be conquered, any foe vanquished, any god cast down. 
The Mythoclast is a Vex instrument from some far-flung corner of time and space, mysteriously fit for human hands. Its origins, mechanism of action, and ultimate purpose remain unknown. Perhaps it will reveal itself to you, in time...
