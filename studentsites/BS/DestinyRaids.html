Raid is a game mode of Destiny. Raids are 6-player cooperative events that are of high challenge, and require communication between players to succeed.They involve specific quests for groups of fireteams.No waypoints or explicit objectives are provided.
<br> <br>
Overview:
Raids differ from Strikes in a few ways:

6 player fireteams, as opposed to 3.
No matchmaking. A player must form a fireteam beforehand or search on an LFG (Looking For Group) site.
In Destiny 2 the new Guided Games feature allows solo-players to seek out Clan members to play with in end-game activities such as raids.
Raid enemies will have abilities not found elsewhere in the game (i.e. unique enemies, debuffs, etc).
Strikes last roughly half an hour, whereas raids can take up to several hours.
Raids have no objective markers. A player must find out where to go and what to do by themselves.
Raids can be dropped and picked up at a later time in the week. Players don't have to finish them in one sitting, but they do have to finish it before their checkpoint expires every Tuesday.
Players will have the opportunity to acquire gear and weapons specific to a raid once an encounter is complete. The gear that drops from the raids will often have perks specific to that raid and are intended to make the raids easier if a player chooses to equip a piece of armor or a weapon from that specific raid, although they are not bound to that activity.
<br> <br>
Difficulty:
Two difficulty levels exist for raids: normal, and hard. The normal mode must be completed before the harder ones can be attempted. This means that players who have completed the normal difficulty cannot take players through the hard mode even if they are not the fireteam leader. The normal mode is designed to teach players raid mechanics, and how to operate as a team. The hard mode provides tougher enemies, additional objectives and a harsher death penalty.

Normal Mode: Players need to wait 30 seconds before a teammate can revive them. Each encounter has easier objectives and enemies are easier to kill. Weapons and armor dropped from normal mode raids drop at a lower Light cap than hard mode raids.
Hard Mode: Players cannot be revived at all during an encounter (with the exception of self-reviving Sunsingers) but will automatically respawn if the fireteam progresses to the next checkpoint. Also, more difficult obstacles are included, such as additional objectives, harder-to-kill enemies, etc. The Light cap for items dropped in the hard mode is higher than the normal mode, and some weapons and armor pieces may drop that are exclusive to the hard mode, such as the 'Harrowed' armor and weapons from King's Fall and the Spliced armor from Wrath of the Machine.
In Destiny 2, the Hard Raid has been renamed as the Prestige Raid.
