<p> I will start by saying I have been playing the game since the spring of 2010 so I have observed how the game has evolved and then devolved over the course of the years.

First I will have to mention that Riot Games have never been the "cool guys" they pretend to be and you will be able to tell for yourselves from everything I'm about to say. The company might have started with a couple of guys that actually enjoyed games and talking to the players but the ones that held the power never had such thoughts in mind and all they ever wanted was money.

When the game first started development they hired Steve 'Pendragon' Mescon, the creator of the most popular dota forum at the time, DotA-Allstars.com. Pendragon has then closed the forum and posted an ad to league of legends for when people tried to access it, the forum also had an ideas section where people could come up with hero ideas that could be added to dota if chosen and the creator would be credited. After closing the forum to the public, Riot has mined the ideas section and used what they got from it to make some of the champions, such as rammus, jarvan 4 and teemo. What is even more disgusting than this is that years later Riot has released a blog post on how they created teemo, you can find out more about this by watching Richard Lewis' "The TRUE Birth of Teemo" video.

Even with such evil people in the leading roles there were undoubtedly some good people at Riot that made the great game it once was, those people have been kicked from the team and replaced by people based on nepotism or people with the weird way of thinking that had started to develop within the company. You might not believe it but there was a time when you would never see nor hear the word "toxic" or people getting banned for saying "offensive words", and it was not chaos as you would expect. There were a lot of people that enjoyed the game for the sake of it, for its gameplay and for its soul which it now lacks, when you care about something you will obviously eventually get mad at something, maybe at your own weakness, maybe at others' weaknesses, this was not something that only LoL had, it was the outcome of the history of competitive games, the majority who played the game were old dota players, it wasn't pure hate as the fools at Riot had thought, it was passion.

In the history of League of Legends you will see one recurring thing, that options from the game have slowly been removed, lowering the skill ceiling for one simple reason and that is money. Dota 2 has started becoming pretty popular with their invite system in 2012 and with it's release in 2013. At first riot's aim was to bring in the dota players, but now they were scared of losing them to dota 2, so they have started their plan to bring into the game new players who hadn't played before. Even tho the game wasn't that complicated for some reason they felt it needed to be easier, much easier, so easy that even your grandmother could play, and so since 2013 their plan had started. 

The following are changes they have done to the game in order to lower the skill ceiling and entry floor for new players to more easily get into the game, the price of which was the sacrifice of the old players.
