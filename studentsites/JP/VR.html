    <h2>The First VR Headset</h2>
    <p>Nintendo’s 1995 Virtual Boy is the first VR headset that was used for gaming, however there were VR headsets made before this, except they were mainly used for experimenting with what was possibly at the time. The player uses the console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. </p>

	<p>There are lots of new VR games being created and released in recent times, due to the advancements in technology, such as getting body trackers with allow you to immerse yourself more into the game. Whilst they are expensive to initially buy, the overall experience is breath-taking and something that has to be done before the technology is made for our entire body to be in the game itself. </p>
