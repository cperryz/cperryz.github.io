<h1>Manchester City’s wonderful Premier League campaign continued with a 4-1 win over West Ham United at the London Stadium.</h1>
<img width="680" height="395" src="https://mediacdn.mancity.com/-/media/matches/first-team/season-1718/away/west-ham-29-apr/0-1-cele.ashx?width=384">
<p>It was our 30th Premier League win of the season, equalling Chelsea’s record set in 2016-17 with three matches still to play.</p>

<p>We have now scored 102 goals this season, just one short of the Premier League best set by Chelsea in 2009-10.</p>
<p>City started brightly and were dominating possession when Ilkay Gundogan almost put us ahead after eight minutes – but he couldn’t quite get on the end of Kyle Walker’s low cross from the right. It would have been a fitting end to a fine team move had the German applied the finishing touch.
Leroy Sane broke to deadlock five minutes later when his effort from distance flicked off Patrice Evra’s head and wrongfooted Adrian in the West Ham goal.
And our lead doubled when Declan Rice failed to deal with Kevin De Bruyne’s low cross as the West Ham defender’s attempted clearance brushed off Pablo Zabaleta and trickled into the net.
That was City’s 100th Premier League goal of the campaign making us the fastest team to reach 100 top-flight goals in a season (35 games) since Everton in 1931-32 (32 games).
We were in total control and enjoying the freedom of the large London Stadium pitch - but Aaron Cresswell halved the arrears with a fine free-kick after Gundogan brought down Edmilson Fernandes on the edge of the area.
But City remained on the front foot despite the setback and Raheem Sterling almost restored City’s two goal lead with a powerful right-footed effort from inside the area but Adrian produced a fine stop to parry it away.</p>

<p>City stepped up a gear after the restart and scored a quite brilliant third. Gabriel Jesus played a defence-splitting throughball to release Sterling down the right. He bided his time before finding Jesus with a return ball and the Brazilian skipped past Zabaleta with a wonderful first touch before finishing past Adrian.
City were now playing with real vim and vigour, with West Ham struggling to cope, and Sterling, at his brilliant best for long periods of the game, was denied a clear penalty when he was brought down by Cresswell inside the area.
Another sweeping move saw City make it 4-1. Fernandinho won the ball high up the field and set Sterling free down the right. He once again held up play superbly before finding the perfect cross for Fernandinho, who had run 30 yards to finish first-time past Adrian - the Brazilian, the complete midfielder, underlining his credentials as a world-class player with a moment of real quality.</p>
City, looking supremely confident, dominated possession in the final stages and saw the game out comfortably.

<p>City’s third. At 2-1, West Ham sensed they could get something from the game but Jesus’ wonderful finish, eight minutes into the second half, killed off the home side’s hopes.</p>
