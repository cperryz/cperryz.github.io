	"<p>A new manager in a new country with an unfamiliar group of players who’ve won it all – far from a task of merely keeping the Bavarian juggernaut on track, Guardiola set about taking the players he had to the next level. Guardiola made a stunning start to life at City, winning his first 11 games in charge and was twice nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Month award in August and September 2016.</p>";

	"<p>“ Talented young Brazilian goalkeeper... ”</p>"+
	"<p>The Brazilian goalkeeper, who impressed for the Portuguese champions throughout the 2016/17 campaign, joined City on 1 July 2017. Ederson enjoyed a fantastic first campaign with City and was an integral part of the Blues' Premier League title success and was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award 2018.</p>";

	"<p>Kyle Walker joined City from Tottenham on a five-year deal in July 2017. He opted to take the number two shirt previously worn by Bacary Sagna and became City’s third signing of the 2017 close season. Walker has impressed during his first campaign in sky blue, and has been a constant presence in the side - he said he wanted trophies to add to his CV and has won the Carabao Cup and Premier League in his first season.</p>";

	"<p>Defender</p>"+
	"<p>“ Leader by example in a golden period of City history ”</p>"+
	"<p>Captain, leader, defensive rock – Vincent Kompany is one of the most decorated skippers in the club’s history. Strong in the air, comfortable on the ball, accurate in the tackle and always ready to nip in and pinch the ball off a striker’s toes, the Belgian was a bargain buy when bought from Hamburg at just £6million in 2008. He made a welcome return to action towards the end of the 2016/17 campaign, rediscovering some of his best form and winning his place back in the Belgium national side and though he was sidelined for several weeks during the 2017/18 campaign, he returned to lift the Carabao Cup as well as score in the 3-0 win over Arsenal - his sixth winner's medal while a City player. Kompany became City's mist successful captain ever when he lifted the Carabao Cup trophy and Premier League crown in 2017/18.</p>";

	"<p>Defender</p>"+

	"<p>A tough Argentine international teammate of Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis and Pablo Zabaleta, Nicolas Otamendi joined City from Valencia in the 2015-16 summer transfer window. His Blues debut came as a substitute at home to Juventus, but he was soon featuring regularly in the starting line-up. Since then, he;s become an integral member of the City starting XI, helping the Blues to two trophies in 2017/18 as well as being voted in the 2018 PFA Team of the Year.</p>";

	"<p>Benjamin Mendy from Monaco joined City from AS Monaco in July 2017. The 23-year-old France international has signed a five-year deal with the Club and will wear the number 22 shirt. He made his senior international debut in March and already has four caps. Everyone at Manchester City is pleased to welcome Benjamin to the Club.</p>";

	"<h1>Fernandinho</h1>"+
	"<p>Midfielder</p>"+
	"<p>“ Classy, understated and able to mix silk and steel ”</p>"+
	"<p>Fernandinho is the consummate midfield anchor man. Although his main role is as a defensive midfielder, the Brazil international can also play in an advanced role and chips in with his quota of goals each season making him a threat to the opposition in both halves of the field. Swapping Ukraine for Manchester in 2013, Fernandinho made an immediate impact, becoming a key piece of the jigsaw in the Club’s engine room and making 41 appearances as City lifted the Premier League title and Capital One Cup. He quickly became a fans’ favourite and his move to Manchester reignited his international career that had been dormant for several years during his time in the Ukraine. His fifth campaign in sky blue was arguably his best, playing the anchor role with typical ease and class as the Blues romped to the Premier League title.</p>";

	"<p>David Silva arrived at City in the summer of 2010, having agreed to join the Blues after the World Cup. It would prove to be one of the most inspired purchases by the Club in the modern era. Silva won his 100th cap for Spain at Euro 2016 to confirm his lofty status for both club and country and has made an excellent start to the 2016/17 season -some believe his best yet - and won his first MCFC Player of the Year award as recognition of his efforts. It was his eight campaign that saw the Spaniard produce his best football yet as he won his third Premier League title and won a nomination for PFA Player of the Year as well as being voted into the PFA Team of the Year for only the second time. </p>";

	"<h1>Kevin De Bruyne</h1>"+
	"<p>Midfielder</p>"+
	"<p>“ One of Europe's best attacking players... ”</p>"+
	"<p>Known as one of the continent’s assist kings, Kevin De Bruyne arrived at City with a huge reputation but after just one full season with the Blues, it was easy to understand why the Club were so keen to secure his services. De Bruyne’s creativity and eye for defence splitting passes and crosses prompted City to sign the Belgian international in the summer transfer window of 2015/16. De Bruyne quickly became an integral part of the Blues’ attack, orchestrating, providing and often finishing moves that quickly made him indispensable. Few players have enjoyed such a flying start and his 16 goals and 15 assists bear testament to a stunning first campaign during which he won a record four Etihad Player of the Month awards. Voted the MCFC Player of the Season in 2015/16, De Bruyne had another impressive campaign in 2016/17, topping the Premier League assist list in the process, but it was the 2017/18 campaign that saw the Belgian hit his peak, driving City to the title with some magnificent displays that saw him narrowly beaten to the PFA Player of the Year award.</p>";

	"<p>“ One of English football's brightest young talents ”</p>"+
	"<p>Raheem joined City in July 2015 from Liverpool for a Club record fee, reportedly becoming the most expensive English player of all time in the process. Inspired to become a footballer because of the family home’s proximity to Wembley Stadium, the attacking midfielder began his career at Queens Park Rangers. He scored twice more in the months that remained, totting up an impressive 11 goals from 44 appearances, and made a stunning start to the 2016/17 season, winning the EA Sports Player of the Month and Etihad Player of the Month for September. His third season saw hims score his best ever haul of goals - 23 as of April 2018 - and play a vital role in City's title success, also winning him a nomination for PFA Young Player of the Year.</p>";

	"<h1>Leroy Sane</h1>"+
	"<p>Winger</p>"+
	"<p>“ Exciting, intelligent and versatile attacking midfielder ”</p>"+
	"<p>Technically gifted with pace to boot, Leroy Sane joined City in August 2016 as one of Europe’s hottest prospects. Having attracted interest from the continent’s footballing giants, the attacking midfielder made the switch from Germany to England in a bid to continue his football education. He follows in the footsteps of Ilkay Gundogan in making the move from Germany to Manchester and is the latest in a long tradition of German players who have graced the sky blue shirt. Leroy made his debut away to Manchester United in September 2016 and his displays for City earned a PFA Young Player of the Year nomination. A year and two trophies later and the exciting winger had won the PFA Young Player of the Year after an excellent second season in Manchester.</p>";

	"<p>Attacker</p>"+
	"<p>“ A true City legend and one of the world's best strikers... ”</p>"+
	"<p>Manchester City's all-time record goal-scorer, Kun's professional career started in July 2003 when, aged just 15 years and 13 days, he made his debut for Independiente, becoming the youngest debutant in the Argentine Premier League - a record previously held by the man who became his future father-in-law, none other than Diego Maradona. But Aguero's place in City’s history was secured when he ended the club's 44-year Premier League title wait with his goal in the 94th minute against QPR on the final day of the 2011/12 season. In 2014/15, he had his best season yet in terms of goals, scoring 32 to take his overall tally past 100 in all competitions. In 2015/16 he scored 29 from 42 games – achieving the 100 Premier League goals milestone in the process and he began the 2016/17 season in blistering form with 11 goals in his first six games and ended with 33 goals in all competitions. He broke Eric Brook's 78-year Club record when he scored City's third in a 4-2 win at Napoli to move on to 178 goals for the Blues and thus create a new record. His 30 goals during 2017/18 won him a place in the PFA Team of the Year before injury ended his season with his tally on 199 goals for the Blues.</p>";
