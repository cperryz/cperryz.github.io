<div class="boxed"><blockquote><p>The main e-sports i am going to focus on is counter strike. The origins of counter strike originated from the a modification from the valve game half life in 1999. Counter Strike got so much attention that valve decided to make it and official game in 2000 and is commonly known as Counter-Strike 1.6. The aim of the game is to beat the other team as one is the counter terrorists and the other are terrorists and their objective is to plant the bomb and defend it from the Counter terrorists. The main gamemodes is Bomb defusal and Hostage rescue. Counter-Strike has been a target for cheating in online games since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as "hacking" in reference to programs or "hacks" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers. With the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. </p></blockquote></div>
