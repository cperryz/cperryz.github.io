    <p> IT and Computing at Cheadle College.</p>
	<p></p>	
		<p><h3>December 2021</h3></p>
	<p>So we have survived a full term without any disruption. We have had a great term at Cheadle, a trip to Manchester with L2 students to get primary images for their graphics and web units and good to visit Bolton Uni again to see their VFX department. IF I was 18 their course would be one of my top choices! </p>
		
	<p></p>	
	<p><h3>September 2021</h3></p>	
	<p>At the start of this College year we are looking forward to and hoping for a good, undisturbed year with no more lockdowns! Remote teaching is not good for the sanity of students or teachers.</p>	
	<p>Our new CTEC course is now in it's 2nd year and I am looking forward to delivering the new units with plenty of real tasks with the staff in the organisations we are working with providing good feedback to the students on their final products. Our employer engagement is growing with each new unit and this year we will be working with INTO games, AND Digital and Players' Theatre.</p>
	<p>I am hoping to be able to get out into some local High Schools this year to do more outreach work. With the variable provision of IT and Computing at KS4 it is important to be able to promote the really good courses we have at the 6th Form College!</p>
		
	<p><h3>February 2021</h3></p>	
	<p>So we are back in lockdown! I am currently remote learning with all of my students and what is good about it is the engagement is loads better thann last spring! </p>
	<p>In other positive news we have been improving our engagement with industry and local employers. Before Christmas we worked with the Glossop Arts Project who are a great organisation who do a wide variety of Art and Health related activities for their local community. Our students produced social media posts and ideas based on the "5 Ways to Wellbeing!" The students received great feedback from the staff and it is a project we weill repeat. </p>
	<p>This term we will be designing games and producing prototypes. We are working with volunteers from the industry who will give students advice and feedback about how to develop their game ideas. As part of the INTO Games Careers week we shall be running an aactivity in College to help our students interested in games see the best way into this expanding job market </p>
	 
	 <p><h3>December 2020</h3></p>
	<p>Wow! What a year.   </p>
	<p>So we have sadly finished one year group who I didn't get to see again after March - very strange!   </p>
	<p>I am now working with a Level 2 class whcih has been great and Level 3 classes in years 12 and 13. The vast majority of students are liking being back learning and having some structure. The remote learning is useful every now and then but most people want to be in working in a classroom environment. Let's hope we can get through the rest of the academic year without too much more disruption.   </p>
	 
	 <p> <h3>June 2020</h3></p>
	 <p>So Covid-19 has made massive changes to everything this year. The students have generally been excellent in finding ways to cope and still get some work done. It is a big shame to have walked out of College in March knowing that some of my 2nd year students I may never see again! </p>
	<p>In the last 3 years the students have produced websites with their own animations and images included from those units. This year it hasn't been possible so I have added on the websites page a showreel of the students' animations and a variety of the images they had produced before lockdown! Hopefully they will be able to show these examples of work to future employers. </p>
	 <p> <h3>February 2020</h3></p>
	 <p>This week I have asked some of last year's leavers how they are gettin on - I know several were at Uni but hadn't heard from them all. Just thought I would share comments from a couple of lads who are doing really well after being unsure what career path to take. </p>
	 <p>"Since college I have done a 12 week coding boot camp at Code Nation and this coming Monday I will be starting my first full time position as a junior front end developer at CDL in Stockport."  </p>
	 <p>"I am currently studying Real Estate at Sheffield Hallam University. Glad I decided to go to uni and live away from home learnt alot of new skills and met some great people already. Living on a student loan isn't the easiest especially when your out every other night but over the summer I got into trading with some of my savings and learnt how trading and stocks work which helps support me financially." </p>
	 <p>"Thank you for giving me the knowledge to be able to apply for the places that I want to apply for, and for enabling me to pursue a career in something that I've wanted to do for years." </p>
	 <p>Some great quotes from 3 ex-students. Anyone who is interested in applying for next year the application process is still open. You can get in touch with me using the details on the page or contact the college. </p>
	 <p>We are looking forward to starting the updated Cambridge Technicals course which has some new units in Social Media, Mobile Technology, Cyber Security and many more! </p>
	<p> </p>
	 <p> <h3>August 2019</h3></p>
	 <p> We are currently enrolling students on Level 2 and 3 Cambridge Technicals IT Courses. The course is very enjoyable to teach and the students have really responded well. The first cohort of students I taught achieved some good results and all those who wanted to have been offered university places. Some students have been successful in applying for Degree apprenticeships which seem a very good option! There are some excellent degree courses on offer for Computing and we have taken students to sample the experience at Bolton and Staffordshire universities. </p>
	 
	 
	 <p> <h3>April 2019</h3> </p>
	<p> This year we have been working on Game Design using Construct 2. A really good package for creating quality games with some simple coding. Students are really enjoying it. </p>
	<p>Here is a student's effort!!!</p>
	<a href="games/ws/index.html"> Monster Platformer</a>
	<p> </p>
		<p>Here is my attempt. </p>
	<a href="games/angry/index.html"> Angry at Birds</a>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Also trying out the App Lab on code.org. Seems a nice package so far - just trying out the publish function here: </p>

	 <p> <h3>December 2018</h3> </p>
	<p>A good year for IT at CHeadle College. We had a great intake in September, 24 students (up 6 on last year) for the Extended Diploma Course and we are delivering a 1 A' Level equivalent course for the first time in years to 9 student.</p>
	<p>I have been really pleased with the work rate shown by the students and I have been encouraged by their interest and enthusiasm for all the practical and creative work we have introduced. Students now do graphics units learning Photoshop and Illustrator before developing selected images into an animation using After Effects. These are then showcased on the websites that they make using html, CSS and javascript. You can see evidence of the latest of these on the student websites pages </p>
	 
	<p> <h3>May 2018</h3></p>	
	<p>Here I am adding some videos made by my level 3 students during the Computer Systems unit. The students worked in groups and researched the hardware between them before sharing the results with the class. 2 groups did a poster, 2 a leaflet, 2 a video and 2 a podcast.</p>
	<p> At the end of June we will be contributing examples of work to the end of year show in conjunction with Art, Photography and Creative Media. Expect more examples of high quality work by our students!</p>

	<p> <h3>March 2018</h3></p>
	<p> I have just added an image gallery. These pictures were all taken back in early November for one of our enrichment activites. We visited the Arndale Applestore who took a small group of students on a "photo walk" around the Northern Quarter. This was a great opportunity to find some interesting buildings, angles, graffiti etc.I thought I would add these so mys students - or anyone who's interested could use them. </p>
	<p>I would highly recommend the Applestore for this. Very interesting and engaging staff - the 2 who took us out were professional photographers.  </p>

	<p> <h3> February 2018</h3></p>
	<p>Since Christmas I have been doing Graphics and Animation with year 13. We are using Illustrator, Photoshop and After Effects for animation.</p>
	<p>After Effects seems a lot nicer than Flash for doing simple animations. Also the ability to import layered documents from Illustrator makes it easy to take graphics and animate them for a joint project. We will be putting both of these into a website later!</p>
